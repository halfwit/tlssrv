tlsclient: tlsclient(1) for unix

tlsclient comes with two programs, tlsclient itself and 9cpu which uses tlsclient
to connect to a 9front cpu server and acts as rcpu(1).

Due to the lack of /dev/cons on unix, an additional flag '-f' is added which
causes tlsclient to dup additional copies of it's own stdin and stdout and place
them on additional file descriptors for the child process. The additional file
descriptor numbers are sent as the first two bytes to the child process.

Most of this code is pillaged from jsdrawterm: https://github.com/aiju/jsdrawterm

Usage:
	tlsclient [-f] [ -u user] [ -h host ] [ -a auth ] -p port cmd...
	9cpu [ -u user ] [ -h host ] [ -a auth ] cmd...

Bugs:
	Currently 9cpu uses gnutls, a better alternative is welcome.
