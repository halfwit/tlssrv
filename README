tlsclient: tlsclient(1) for unix

tlsclient comes with two programs, tlsclient itself and 9cpu which uses tlsclient
to connect to a 9front cpu server and acts as rcpu(1).

Most of this code is pillaged from jsdrawterm: https://github.com/aiju/jsdrawterm

Usage:
	tlsclient [ -u user] [ -h host ] [ -a auth ] -p port cmd...
	9cpu [ -u user ] [ -h host ] [ -a auth ] cmd...

Bugs:
	Currently 9cpu uses gnutls, a better alternative is welcome.
