tlsclient: tlsclient(1) for unix

This repo contains three programs, tlsclient itself, 9cpu and git-remote-hjgit.
9cpu acts as rcpu(1).
Git-remote-hjgit is a git remote helper for unix git that allows use of hjgit repos.

Most of the tlsclient code is pillaged from jsdrawterm: https://github.com/aiju/jsdrawterm

Usage:
	tlsclient [ -R ] [ -u user] [ -h host ] [ -a auth ] -p port cmd...
	9cpu [ -u user ] [ -h host ] [ -a auth ] cmd...

Example:
	9cpu -u moody -h shithub.us -a p9auth.shithub.us newrepo tlsclient

	# with git-remote-hjgit in your $PATH
	git clone hjgit://shithub.us/user/repo

Bugs:
	Currently tlsclient uses gnutls, a better alternative is welcome.
